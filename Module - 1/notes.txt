Docker - delivers software in containers.
You can run data pipelines in docker - based on what the dependencies are.. you can use/customize different containers. You don't have to install anything on the Host Computer. 
Ex. You can run PostgreSQL DB within/inside docker, and it will not interfere with the DB installed in your computer/ or other DB's running in the same pipeline-container. 

Docker image - snapshot of your container 
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open source system to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications anywhere.
You can run the image in GC Kubernetes, AWS Batch etc. 

Why use Docker?
- Reproducible.
- Serverless 
- Local experimentation
